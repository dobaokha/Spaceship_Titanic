# Spaceship_Titanic
In this project, I am going to implement what I learned along my journey to become a data scientist. 
I performed the cleaning and EDA process using Python on the Spaceship Titanic dataset, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic
In the future, I will update this repository with the additional section of building a machine learning models to predict the target variable.
